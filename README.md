# Hospital-Database-Project
Hospital database project using a CLI Java application to query it.

To use this properly you'll have to initialize a mySQL local server and import the tables SQL file to make it work. That's a lot of work if you don't have that stuff set-up though. This is more to showcase the java code and queries.  The Main.java file takes the information given by the three text files (person,doctors,treatment) and brings them into the database. Once that is done, the user can then browse the vast list of queries and select one to grab the information they need.
